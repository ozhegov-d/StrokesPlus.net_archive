Disable StrokePlus (Global/App) using a hotkey

Important Note:  
Don't forget to enable this so that when StrokesPlus is disabled, hotkeys still work:  
Options - Advanced - Keep Registered Hot Keys Active When Disabled 

options:  
"exe" = by process name,   
"title" = by window (title+class),  
"all" = ignore everything (except Load/Unload)
