**Dragging starts instantly** when any mouse button (`Left`/`Right`/`Middle`/`XButton1`/`XButton2`)  
is pressed anywhere on the window.

###### <mark>ver. special for LeftButton</mark> 
**Dragging is bound** to the left mouse button anywhere on the window,

v2: via left click (last two windows) – Works for both minimized and maximized windows (works with Telegram).

To find uwpApps  
In PowerShell, you can use the following command to list all installed UWP applications with names containing "Microsoft.":  
Get-AppxPackage | Where-Object { $_.Name -like "Microsoft.*" } | Select-Object Name, PackageFullName  

If JSON has empty title and FilePath:  
"Title": "",  
"ProcessName": "mpc-hc64",  
"FilePath": "",  
and MPC is already running, it won't launch again. The script will find the first available instance of the mpc-hc64 process and will activate it.  

If JSON includes an argument:  
"Title": "windows.json - Everything (1.5a)",  
"ProcessName": "Everything64",  
"Arguments": "-help",  
then the title will be ignored, and the script will find the first available instance of the Everything64 process and will activate it.

Works for both hotkeys and gestures  
First, activate the window with a mouse click, then use the hotkey (you can change the location of the windows using which window was last activated)  
You can also choose how the windows will be positioned (vertically, horizontally, etc.)
