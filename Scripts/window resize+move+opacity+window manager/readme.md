To find uwpApps  
In PowerShell, you can use the following command to list all installed UWP applications with names containing "Microsoft.":  
Get-AppxPackage | Where-Object { $_.Name -like "Microsoft.*" } | Select-Object Name, PackageFullName  

If JSON has empty title and FilePath:  
"Title": "",  
"ProcessName": "mpc-hc64",  
"FilePath": "",  
and MPC is already running, it won't launch again. The script will find the first available instance of the mpc-hc64 process and will activate it.  

If JSON includes an argument:  
"Title": "windows.json - Everything (1.5a)",  
"ProcessName": "Everything64",  
"Arguments": "-help",  
then the title will be ignored, and the script will find the first available instance of the Everything64 process and will activate it.
