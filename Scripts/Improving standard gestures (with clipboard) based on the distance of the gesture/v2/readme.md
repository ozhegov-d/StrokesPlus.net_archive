### Copy-Paste
**Copy**

How it works: if text is selected, it will be copied; if the same text is copied again, it will scroll the page
Depending on the distance of the gesture, you can scroll down a little or to the end of the page
+ It works in almost all applications where scrolling is available
+ If there are two columns on the page, they can be scrolled independently of each other

**Paste**

There are only two states: paste or scroll the page to the top

### Forward-Back
**Forward**

When starting the gesture from a link, the link opens in a new tab;

When starting the gesture not from a link and there is selected text on the page, a new tab opens with a search for the selected text, depending on the length of the gesture;

Short gesture not from a link and with no selected text on the page performs the 'Forward' action.

Long gesture switches the tab if text is not selected 
+ It also works in any application: the browser opens and searches

**Back**

+ short gesture - Back
+ long gesture - Previous tab

**Minimize**

+ long gesture - all windows of one process 

**Return**
+ short gesture - restoring a single window
+ long gesture - all windows of one process

If the window has the same HWnd (and it should be restored), then sp.LastApplication();
