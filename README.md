StrokesPlus.net, the successor to StrokesPlus, is a completely free mouse gesture recognition utility for Windows which allows you to create powerful mouse gestures that save you time.  
With rocker support, modifiers, hot keys, macros, text expansion, and a robust ClearScript interface using the Chrome V8 JavaScript engine built right in, there's virtually no limit to what you can automate.
